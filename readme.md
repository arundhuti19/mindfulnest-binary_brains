Design and Aesthetic
The overall design of MindfulNest is inspired by a cottagecore aesthetic that combines professional elements with a playful, cute vibe.

The background gradient is composed of pastel tones of blue, pink, and purple, reflecting a soothing atmosphere, which is ideal for a mental health platform.
The "Welcome, Pookie!" greeting uses a playful font, Pacifico, paired with an emoji to make users feel at ease and create a friendly, approachable environment.
Professional text such as the mission statement and about sections use the Lora font, adding a serious tone where needed without detracting from the overall cozy design.
Icons throughout the website, courtesy of Font Awesome, ensure a modern and polished look while maintaining functionality.
The structure is designed to be simple yet visually appealing, combining modern web design principles with a caring, inviting atmosphere that encourages users to explore the platform further.

Technologies Used
Front-End Technologies
HTML5: Used to structure the webpage, defining sections such as headers, buttons, links, and forms.
CSS3: The custom stylesheet (index.css) is responsible for the visual layout, including colors, fonts, margins, and button styles. The CSS enhances the user experience by providing a responsive and appealing design that adapts to different screen sizes.
JavaScript: Implemented for interactive elements and dynamic features, specifically for the Health Tracker page, where it enables users to input and track health data such as heart rate, weight, temperature, and step count. JavaScript also powers the data visualization aspects, such as the generation of charts (like bar graphs), which help users analyze their health trends over time.
Typography and Icons
Google Fonts:
Pacifico: A playful, cursive font used in the "Welcome, Pookie!" section to create a friendly and inviting feel.
Lora: A more formal serif font used for the mission statement, about us section, and other professional text to provide a balanced, clean look.
Font Awesome: This library provides icons for the Contact Us section, making it easier for users to recognize communication methods such as email, WhatsApp, Instagram, and YouTube. Font Awesome icons are lightweight and scalable, ensuring compatibility with different screen resolutions.
